# Wiremock NPM

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/wiremock.svg?style=flat-square) ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wiremock)

This is [Wiremock Standalone](http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/) wrapped inside an NPM package.

Run it with:

```shell
npx wiremock
```

It only relies on dependencies found in an NPM package repository. It is created with [JDeploy](https://github.com/shannah/jdeploy) and will download and use a JRE, [node-jre](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-jre), if one is not available.

See: http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/
